1:FACADE PATRERN:User(The social login sites): Shall use, the login factory interface. So here we have the FACADE Pattern, its looks at only the login interface.
2:FACTOR PATTERN:The classes will then be created by this factory(user),which will be singleton classes.These Singleton classes will have a specific implementation of the login interface.
3:OBSERVER PATTERN:The notify class will posses "Notify" Method, which its object Observer will be using.
                   This object is responsible for notifying the end user through its registered email id. 
4:The end user can use the facilities in the singleton classes.
